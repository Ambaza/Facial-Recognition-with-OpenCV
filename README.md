# Facial Recognition with OpenCV

This Python code uses the OpenCV library to perform facial recognition. It captures video from the camera, detects faces and eyes, and draws rectangles around them. It also connects key points on the detected face with green lines.

## Requirements

Before running this application, make sure you have OpenCV installed:

- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)

You can install OpenCV using `pip`:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
```

## How to Use the Application

To use the application, follow these steps:

1. **Run the Application**:
   - Execute the script in your Python environment.

2. **Facial Recognition**:
   - The application will open a live video feed from your camera.

3. **Face and Eye Detection**:
   - The code will detect faces and draw rectangles around them.

4. **Green Lines**:
   - It connects key points on the detected face with green lines.

5. **Quit the Application**:
   - To exit the application, press the 'q' key in the application window.

## Features

- **Live Facial Recognition**: The code captures live video from the camera and detects faces and eyes in real time.

- **Key Point Connection**: It connects key points on the detected face with green lines, making it easier to identify facial features.

## Author

This project was developed by AMBAZA KIMANUKA Armand.

## Future Potential

This facial recognition application has the potential to evolve and offer additional features:

- **Facial Recognition Database**: Enhance the code to recognize and store faces in a database, making it useful for security and access control applications.

- **Emotion Recognition**: Extend the application to recognize facial expressions and emotions, which can have applications in sentiment analysis.

- **Real-time Tracking**: Implement real-time tracking of recognized faces to monitor their movements and interactions.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Create a user-friendly interface for the application with options for different recognition modes and settings.

Contributions from the open-source community can help unlock the full potential of this project.
